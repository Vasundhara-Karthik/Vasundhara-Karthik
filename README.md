****<h3>Hey there! I'm Vasundhara.</h3>****

I am a Biology BS-MS '22 graduateðŸŽ“ from IISER Tirupati, with a specialization in plant stress biologyðŸŒ±. Currently, I am immersed in microbial genomics for AMR surveillance at Ashoka University. I am fueled by my passion to explore BioinformaticsðŸ§¬to decode the secrets of life!

My research interests encompass the epigenetic regulation of genes, particularly during stress, delving into comparative genomics, gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and epidemiological modeling in the field of bioinformatics. 

Additionally, I'm deeply committed to combatting anti-microbial resistance, exploring microbial assembly, and employing genetic engineering techniques like RNAi and CRISPR to understand and mitigate stress responses.


**<h3>Skills</h3>**

ðŸ§ª Proficient in Molecular Biology Techniques: PCR, DNA/RNA Isolation, Gel electrophoresis, and a dash of cloning.   
ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics enthusiast with a focus on Genomics and Transcriptomics.  
ðŸ’» Coding Skills: Python, R, and Shell Scripting (beginner).   


**<h3>Some of my projects....</h3>**

1) Group participation in Vivli AMR data challenge 2023    
2) Comparative Genomics for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance   
3) Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Diverse Plant Species to study stress responses   
4) Insilico Characterization of Kinase-encoding Genes in Vigna mungo   
5) Effect of Thermopriming on Plantsâ€™ response to heat stress

          
     
                                          
Occasionally, I also write technical content about Clinical data validation platforms. I have also contributed to a book chapter on genomics-assisted breeding.
